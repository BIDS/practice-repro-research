# The Practice of Reproducible Research

## Case Studies and Lessons from the Data-Intensive Sciences

### Justin Kitzes, Daniel Turek, Fatma Deniz (Eds.)

This is the open, online version of the book _The Practice of Reproducible Research_, to be published in print form by the University of California Press in 2017. 

This book contains a collection of 31 case studies of reproducible research workflows, written by academic researchers in the data-intensive sciences. Each case study describes how the author combined specific tools, ideas, and practices in order to complete a real-world research project. Emphasis is placed on the practical aspects of how the author organized his or her research to make it as reproducible as possible.

The [Introduction](core-chapters/1-intro.md) and Part I of the book present general information about working reproducibly and synthesizes common themes from across the case studies. This summary section can be read as a stand alone introduction for beginners wishing to learn more about the general practices of reproducible research. Parts II and III of the book contain the 31 case study chapters themselves.
